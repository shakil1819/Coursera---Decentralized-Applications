We will explore the notion of the blockchain server as the foundation for a Decentralized Application. We will demonstrate how to install the blockchain server and establish a peer-to-peer network of nodes. It is a common practice to develop and test a Dapp on a local test network before deploying it on a public network.

### Learning Objectives
