# Dapp Defined

[MUSIC] On completion of this lesson, you will be able to explain the architecture of the Dapp, explain at high level, the access from web client to the blockchain server. What is a Dapp? A Dapp, or decentralized application, solves a problem that requires blockchain services and blockchain infrastructure for realizing its purpose. Typically, a Dapp has a web front-end, and a blockchain back end, and the code connecting the two. In such an architecture, the front-end of a Dapp channels any external stimulus from the users to the blockchain infrastructure and returns any response back to them. It initiates transactions to invoke functions on the smart contract. That in turn, records the transactions and state transition and receipts on the blockchain. The front-end of a Dapp can be as simple as a command line interface. It can also be a sophisticated web app or an easy to use mobile app. The front-end development may involve development of a web client with the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS's, and other web assets, or a web app framework, such as Express. Here, the blockchain server is the E-node on the underlying infrastructure. And the front-end is a web client with embedded web3.js script, communicating using JSON over RPC pipeline. Recall from course two that web3 deploy script is an important artifact generated by the remix compile process. We'll use a simple web app as a front-end for the Dapps we develop in this course. If you are programmatically assembling the Dapp without the help of any development involvement, you copy the web3 deploy script into your app, say an HTML JavaScript file as a script. Deploy the smart contract using the functions in the script. And invoke the smart contract function using the functions in the script, and the ABI, and the smart contract address. At this time, if you're a programmer, you can review the web3 deploy script generated in the Remix IDE. Don't worry, we plan to use an IDE to simplify the development of a Dapp later on in the module two of this course. Thus far, we covered the foundational concepts of a Dapp. Now for the first time, we are looking at the architecture of a Dapp. Here is a simple Dapp architecture with the nodes that we created earlier with geth command and Ethereum blockchain server and the network. Once the nodes have been initialized with the same network, you can send transactions using the command line interface. Also, you should be able to deploy a smart contract from the command line. Be aware that these commands may have lengthy payloads and parameters that may span multiple lines. Moreover, command line interface may not be familiar to a non-programmer or a user of a Dapp. So we will use a simple but intuitive web interface as the front-end to the blockchain Dapp we are planning to develop. Here is an updated architecture for a Dapp. There are multiple full nodes, with only three of them, Node1, Node2, NodeN, shown. Geth command is used to expose RPC port 8544 using the commands geth--rpc--rpcport 8544. From the web client, the functions including smart contract deploy and invoke functions are facilitated through web3.js module. To summarize, we explored the installation of an Ethereum blockchain server, a single node, and a network of peer to peer nodes. We also examined two alternatives for the Dapp architecture. One with command line client and the other with a web client. In the next lesson, we'll explore some support APIs for developing a Dapp.
