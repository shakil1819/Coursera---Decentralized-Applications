# Web Interface & Testing (Part 1) (Front-End Demo)
![[Week 2/3.Web Interface & Testing/attachments/index_2.mp4]]


[MUSIC] In this lesson, we are going to add the web interface to the DApp. In order to follow along, we have created a pre-filled ballot DApp. You can copy this into your workspace and work along. There is a zip file in the resources called Ballot2.zip. Upon completion of this lesson, you will be able to list the changes to be made to the base code of the Ballot.sol to link to the user interface, and to integrate the user interface front-end to the ballot smart contract, and the blockchain backend. In order to accomplish this, copy Ballot2.zip into your workspace. Unzip the Ballot2.zip. Note the directory structure that appears. This may be the base structure needed for any DApp project. Note there are few more files and directories than previously outline. We know that contracts has solidity contracts. Migration folder has migration scripts. Test has the test scripts. Build has the JSON artifacts generated by the compile process. Source folder has the web assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and index HTML. Node module folder has the node.js modules. And JSON files and JavaScript are the configuration files. Now, navigate to the source directory that provides the web assets. There is an file called app.js in the source Java's directory. This instantiates the objects needed for the web client to communicate with the blockchain node. We need to expose the blockchain accounts created through web3 provider object of the app. Simply put, web3 init code does that. It shows how web3 object is created and linked to the test chain we've applied. Secondly, we need to tell the web3 where to find the smart contract artifacts. Init contract method of the app.js does this. Then, you'll have to add methods to handle the calls to the smart contract, and return values from the smart contract to the web interface. So far we have created the backend of the DApp. We've initialized using truffle in it, compile, deployed, and tested it. Now let's see how we can add the front-end. And so, going through the init process, which is beyond the block ten protocol, we've given you the complete DApp in Ballot2.zip in your resources. Copy that into your current folder and let's explore. And I'm going to do that Ballot2.zip from your resources into this folder, and we have it here. Now I'm going to unzip it. And it's going to create a whole lot of files, and I'm just going to clear. And let's see, we got a nice little directory Ballet2 going there. And we can see that, it's got a lot more folders than we had before, but there are quite a few familiar ones, contracts, migration, build, and source, and test. And source is what holds all the web assets for your application, the front-end, and also the JSON files that you have. The node modules hold the server end of it. The node JS's our little lightweight server that's going to solve the HTTP request. And so, let's go into the source. We're going to look at only one of the files that's going to act as a glue. And one particular one is JavaScript file and that is app.js, and we already have it open in Adam. And I just want to point to a couple of functions there, as you will later on use this template to develop your front-end. I'm creating an app object that initializes the web3 object that is going to be the receiver of all the blockchain reports from your front-end application. And it's going to pass it on to your underlying RPC endpoint that you have opened up in your blockchain. And then, there is also a init contract, that is init a web3 object. And that init contract, which is going to point out to all the artifacts that is needed for your smart contract, in this case Ballot.json. Beisdes that, we have other support functions. The one that I want to point out are, handleRegister, handles the register function of your smart contact. handleVote, that's a glue for your vote function of your smart contract. And handleWinner, that is a Function that handles the winningProposals of your smart contract. And so, you can use this as a template for developing your front-end. And this is an important file that acts as a the pipeline between your underlying smart contract and the front-end. Now let's go back, and I'm going to go to the base folder, if you come too far inside. And this is my base folder, because I see contracts and build in it. I'm just going to be compiling this. I can compile. I can deploy. I can do all that in one command truffle test. But anyway, but I'll go through the process of compiling. And next test, truffle. Let's test it, okay? And we've added a few more test cases. And you can see all the test cases pass, ten test cases. You can go and explore test.js to understand more about the test cases. And then, I'm going to do truffle migrate. This is very, very important you say a reason, because we did test a couple of ballots before this. And so, we want to overwrite this with a newer version of it. And so, I'm going to be deploying a newer version. I don't know whether we made any changes, but still. Anyway, we've deployed a newer version of it. And finally, I'll have to run lite server. And I'm going to do that. This is for the webpage that we're going to mpm run development server, run dev, and that will open up a web end point, which is going to display all our web assets. We have three handle functions corresponding to the three functions of the ballot smart contract, function handleRegister(), function handleVote() and function handleWinner(). There are other supporter utility methods of functions that are beyond the blockchain protocol. These are the user interface designer's responsibility. However, we provide these functions for completion. Please review these. Let's navigate back to the valid base directory. In order to create a web interface, minimally you'll need an index.html file. We have also added other web assets, such as the images for the items we are voting on, funds, and CSS style file. At this time, you have at least two choices. If you have the front-end development skill, you can create your own front-end, or just use the web assets given in the source directory. Review all the files.
