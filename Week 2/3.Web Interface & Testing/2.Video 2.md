# Web Interface & Testing (Part 2) (Metamask Demo)

![[Week 2/3.Web Interface & Testing/attachments/index.mp4]]

[MUSIC] Now you're ready to go through the development process once again. Restart the test chain. Truffle develop in a different terminal. Truffle compile from the base directory of the Ballot. Truffle migrate --reset. We don't need the test command, we are done with it. Now, let's go to the browser. Start the Chrome browser. Go to the metamask.io., get the metamask extension for Chrome. Accept the conditions twice. You will see a brown MetaMask face installed as a plugin into the Chrome. MetaMask is a bridge between our blockchain server and the web. We've added it as a Chrome extension. This is the preferred approach for our explorations. MetaMask is like a digital wallet that provides features to connect to the underlying blockchain node, and manage accounts, guess points for transactions, and the balances. MetaMask also provides a simple interface to sign the transaction and transfer guess points needed for the execution of the transactions. MetaMask installs quickly. It is easy to use. Don't hesitate to remove it and add it again in case it goes out of sync with your blockchain server. Now, let's see how we can link MetaMask to the blockchain server. In the truffle IDE default port for the test chain deployed by truffle develop command is 9545. Account addresses are exposed through this port. Let's now link MetaMask to manage it for our DApp. I have the frontend node ready and the MetaMask has all the accounts, and I have here created about four or five accounts, and I'm just going to start off by [COUGH] registering some of the accounts. So, let's see. Register that. Okay, that should go successfully, okay, and then it will show that it's successful. And I'm going to go to the next account. These were the support functions you formed in the app.js that brought about these to the [COUGH] web. Okay, and that was registered successfully, and then I'm going to go into the third account, A2 [INAUDIBLE] and register. Remember that we're going from the owner, and three accounts have been registered. And let's run through one more, but this time I'm going to go to account number 2. Account number 2, and try to register. Let's see what happens. And you can see there's something happening here. There's no, okay, I just say Submit, and okay. I'm just going to increase that, and then Submit, and you will see that registration failed, because it was from account number 2, but only owner can do it, okay. So anyway we've registered three of them, and let's see whether we can vote on all of them. So I'm just going to go back to one. Start voting from Account 1. Account number 1 has got twice them, so let's see whether we can vote for banana. The owner is voting for the banana. That's good, and that went successfully. And the rest of them, the three of them outsiders other than the owner are going to vote for some other, maybe apple this time. So we'll vote for apple, and it should go through fine and successfully, and let's see we have one more. Account 3, and that's also apple, and that went through all right. And you can see the guess points and other things are indeed truly reflected and taking care of the MetaMask management, and I'm going to go click on 4. And again, vote for apple. That should go though fine. You can see the guess limit. Everything displayed, and finally I'm just going to go to account number 5, which has not being registered, and see what happens here. It has not been registered, we do have test case, and I'm just going to see whether it can vote. And you can see that there's no guess limit here, that means that account is unknown, when I submit it's going to say failed, because we do have a test case holding it making sure that it will not work. Not this case but the solidity contract is written in such a way unregistered cannot vote. So we have voted enough, and let's see whether we can declare the winner, it should be apple. Yes, the apple is the winner, and that is the complete DApp demo. In summary, we learned to set up a web frontend, and tested a complete DApp, and you observed that Truffle provides a user-friendly environment for developing and testing a DApp. By now, truffle commands should be quite familiar to you. Develop, edit, compile, migrate, test, all with truffle in front of them, and with any parameters you may need. This module illustrated all the steps needed in developing and testing a complete DApp. That's great. Please make sure you're able to complete the development and testing before moving on.
