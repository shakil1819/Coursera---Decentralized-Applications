# Event Handling (Part 2) (Coin Demo)

![[Week 3/2.Event Handling/attachments/index_2.mp4]]

[MUSIC] You can illustrate the event logging using the Coin smart contract. I already copied the coin.zip from our resources. Let me unzip it and and that'll create all the artifacts needed for the coins, so I'm just going to go into the Coin folder where I have it. So you can look at it in the contracts and the Coin.sol has three functions including the constructor, the Coin constructor, Mint, where the coins are minted by only the minter, and the Transfer that can happen between any account when the transfer is completed. A sent event is logged with three attributes, sender, receiver, and amount, and you can see the event getting defined here. And let's run it and see. And I'm going to truffle compile, and you can directly go to test if you would like. And I'm also going to test it, we put some test cases here and you can examine that later on by looking at the test.js. Truffle test, and then you can see the test, and then I'm going to go into truffle migrate, Reset. That's it. Test takes care of it but I'm just going to go through and have it done anyway. So and, at this point, I'm going to run the npm lite-server And that opens up the posts, and this is the interface you would see. There's an interface for the minter, which is check balance, mint coin, and send coin. There's another interface for all the regular accounts which doesn't have the mint coins. Okay, so let's go back to our, Metamask interface and, Go to local host and, And you can see, this is the interface the regular account will look like. And I've already created the content Metamask. Since it's Account 4, the interface is only check balance and send coins, so let's see whether we can do Account 1. In Account 1, and I'm going to refresh it to see the interface that you have. When I check balance, I have zero balance. So I have to mint some coins, so I'm going to mint coins and I'm going to mint for myself or the creator of the account, I'm going to use 2,000 coins not Ether. And 2,000 coins will be created, this is mean successfully created as we can see above. And I'm going to check the balance, of course, let's refresh. And I'm going to check the balance in this [INAUDIBLE]. Now, you can send coins to any other account, I'm going to send some coins, it would be 600 coins to that account, and then we sent it, and it's asking for [INAUDIBLE]. As you can see, this is the event log, 600 coins were sent from this account, that is the Account 1 to the account, another account that we have. And let's check the balance of that account. So I'm going to go back to the second account in here. And Account 2, and refresh. And I have here the interface with just two functions, and I'm going to check balance. And you can see, the $600 that you sent came in. And I'm going to exercise the send, and I'm going to send back to the owner, maybe 300 of that, and I'm just going to send. And it's going to ask for, and you can see, 300 coins were sent from the owner, not the owner, the current account holder to the owner of the smart contract. And let's go back and check whether the smart contract owner received, that the minter received the $300, so I'm going to go back in to Account 1, and refresh to get my interface, and I'm going to check the balance, it should 1,700. Summarizing, we explored the use of event feature in solidity for pushing events and logging events. We also had another chance to try our hand a Truffle IDE & Dapp development processes with Coin smart contract and became more familiar with the interaction of UI and Metamask with an underline blockchain server.
