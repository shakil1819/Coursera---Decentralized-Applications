# Dapp Models (Part 2)

[MUSIC] The next Dapp model is decentralized marketplace. This is an easy, low hanging fruit of a Dapp. We define marketplace broadly. It could be Dapp for anything from selling goods to education credentialing. Remember, a marketplace facilitates meetings of sellers and buyers. You can build a marketplace platform where decentralized buyers and sellers, those unknown to one another, can meet and exchange items with the payment and transaction recorded on any of the established blockchain technologies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. You can always use Bitcoin as a payment system for the global marketplace you build. Is there a smart contract code for supporting buying or selling? Yes, there is. An example is safe remote purchase smart contract in purchase.sol in the solidity documentation. One more Dapp to discuss is FinTech. FinTech, short for financial technology, has great potential for innovator Dapps. This domain ranges from decentralized investment instrument to micropayment channels. Currently, a significant issue for FinTech Dapps is the high confirmation times of the transactions compared to the centralized technologies. At the time of this recording, Dapps cannot meet the sub-second trade confirmation times that the centralized systems can deliver for stock trading. In this case, scalability is a dominant issue. Privacy is another issue to be considered in this context. Regulation and policies of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, and the counterpart organization in many countries, have an effect on the FinTech Dapps and their development. Security, privacy, safety, and fraud prevention are major issues. In fact, tokens, coins, and ICO Dapps provide a backdoor entry for many investors and financial institution into the cryptocurrency markets. In summary, in this lesson, we looked at a few of the Dapp models. We have not covered them all. And many innovative models have yet to be created. After all, Uber and AirBnB sharing apps came into existence 30 years after the advent of the Internet. You can use the Dapp models discussed as an inspiration and as a guideline to create a Dapp for your application domain.
