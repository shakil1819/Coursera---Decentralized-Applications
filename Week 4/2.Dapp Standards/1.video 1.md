# Dapp Standards (Part 1)

![[Week 4/2.Dapp Standards/attachments/index_3.mp4]]


Our focus in this last lesson is on standards. Anytime the growth of a technology explodes exponentially in many directions, and that too with the deep and broad impact on all walks of life from politics to pet shop, we need to pay attention to bringing some order. This expectation is not unusual. Let's take a look back at the history of computing, when operating systems became a big deal. Portable Operating System Interface or POSIX standards were introduced for interoperability among different operating systems. IETF, the Internet Engineering Task Force, was established for defining the Internet standards through the Request for Comments, RFCs. Think about it, flights can land in any compliant airport in any country because of those International Standards Organization, or ISO Aviation Standards. Standards bring order, safety, and many more qualitative attributes to the field. Standards can bring regulation and clarity. They are specially imperative for a nascent and high-interest technology such as a block chain. After this lesson, you will be able to explain the importance of standards to DApps and explain importance of ERC20 and ERC721 tokens. Let's see how standards are implemented in Ethereum. EIP is an approach to process improvement in Ethereum ecosystem. EIP or Ethereum Improvement Proposal is a means to manage the protocol specification, improvements, updates, client APIs and contract standards. EIP handles issues at four different categories including; core, or core Ethereum protocol, network, or network level improvement, interface, or interfaces such as ABI and RPC, and ERC, or application level conventions and standards. In this lesson, we are interested in only two ERCs, ERC20 and ERC721 standards. So, what are ERCs? ERC is Ethereum Request for Comments, like RFCs of the Internet. ERC proposal for application level issues are given a proposal ID, thus, become ERCN. Example, ERC20, ERC721, et cetera. The solution draft is proposed by the ERC document and discussed in the community. The ERCs are available on the GitHub and discussed on the guitar and subreddits. The result could be accepted, rejected, withdrawn or deferred. An accepted ERC is finalized and is allocated an EIP number and implemented by the protocol. We'll discuss two of the many ERCs that are making a splash in the DApp run, ERC20 and ERC721. Let's consider coins and tokens. As you might remember, anybody can mint coins and issue tokens. Previously, there were no standards to do this. In the last lesson, we looked at the solidity code for the coin smart contract. You observed that we could easily mint digital coins of any amount we wanted and transfer a coin from one account to another. You experienced how easy it is to issue a coin on your own and transact. You can name your coins something fancy, and deploy it on the Ethereum main chain and issue this digital currency to the whole decentralized world to buy. Anybody with an internet connection can connect and transact using your coin. Given this context, let's consider the issues. What does a token represent? What is the value of this token? What can I do with it? Is it an investment, or utility token? Can I exchange it for another type of token? Can I exchange it for any fiat currency? Is it fungible, or non-fungible? Do you remember non-fungible? Are the tokens limited in number? And many more. These, and many issues are addressed in the standard ERC20 and ERC721. ERC20 is specified as a smart contract interface. It specify a set of rules that allow token DApps to interact with each other to be exchanged with each other, and transact on Ethereum network. The interface looks like this. Given this interface, how do you make a token ERC20 compliant? Of course, you have to implement the functions required by ERC interface. Recall our discussion of interface in the last module. Contract MyToken is ERC20Interface // implement the functions required by ERC20Interface standard // other functions. Can you list some ERC compliant tokens? Augur REP, rep we discussed earlier is a ERC20 token. Here are some ERC20 tokens. You can see many more tokens in this hitscan. We'll know how to distinguish fungible token versus non-fungible tokens.
