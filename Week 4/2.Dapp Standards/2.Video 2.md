# Dapp Standards (Part 2)

[MUSIC] ERC 20 is a fungible token. Dictionary definition of fungible says, able to replace or be replaced by another identical item, mutually interchangeable. One ordinary US dollar bill is equal in value to any other ordinary US dollar bill. One bitcoin is equal in value to any other bitcoin. One ether is equal to any other ether. This is the concept of fungible. Value of this token is intrinsic. Now consider Puppy A, identified by one Puppy Token A. Puppy B, identified by one Puppy Token B. Of course, Puppy Token A is not equal in value to Puppy Token B. They cannot be exchanged one to one. This is the concept of non-fungible. Consider another example. Compare an ordinary penny with a collectible penny. They are one token, or one penny each, physically, but their values are not the same. Another example is Pokemon cards. How about baseball cards? How about real estate? The values differ. In these cases and many more practical examples, a given token value may appreciate or depreciate depending on many factors. This culminates in what is known as the non-fungible token, tokens that cannot be exchanged one-to-one. And ERC 721 is a non-fungible token standard. The non-fungible token concept was brought to prominence by the DApp, CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties is an ethereum ERC-721 compliant tool. It became widely popular, exposing many to the cryptoworld. Of course, since it conforms to ethereum 721 token, it piggybacks on the ethereum blockchain. There was a time it contributed to 30% of the traffic and to the clogging of the Ethereum main net traffic with a backlog of 30,000 transactions. This DApp is hailed as an innovation on many fronts, including but not limited to crypto gaming and crypto collectibles. More importantly, innovation of ERC-721 is in proving that the fixed value for a token may not hold in many practical situations. In this respect, ERC-721 standard has an enormous potential beyond digital cats and collectibles. It has opened up a whole new area of application for DApps. ERC 721 represents just the beginning of many more standards to come. ERC token standards are being proposed for identity, governance, and security. These tokens and EIPs of ethereum are sure to transform Dapp ecosystem into a mainstream application framework, and decentralization into a norm. In summary, we discussed ethereum improvement proposal, and ERC process that are essential for keeping ethereum blockchain updated. We also explored the standards ERC-20 for fungible tokens and ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens. Let's summarize the course as a whole. We opened up the course with a module on essential concepts such as blockchain server, Dapp architecture, and the details of the support APIs. We experience a hands-on, practical, incremental, end to end development of a Dapp using the Truffle IDE. We then explored important smart contract specific best practices to improve the basic design of a Dapp. We concluded the course with standards that are essential for transforming an emerging technology into a more mature technology. On with this road map of the Dapp development process. You are now ready to chart your path through the emerging decentralized software culture.
